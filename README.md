# Health Monitoring and Analysis 🏥📊

Welcome to the **Health Monitoring and Analysis** project! This repository contains a health data analysis focused on various health metrics such as **Heart Rate**, **Blood Pressure**, **Body Temperature**, **Oxygen Saturation**, **Sleep Quality**, and **Stress Level**. The goal is to explore patterns and relationships within the data to gain insights about health metrics across different groups.

## Project Overview 🔍
This analysis uses a health dataset to examine various metrics, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and more. We explore how these metrics vary with factors like age, gender, and activity levels. The data is processed to handle missing values and outliers, followed by visualizations and correlations to draw meaningful conclusions. 📊

## Data Description 📈
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **PatientID**: Unique identifier for each patient 🆔
- **Age**: The age of the patient 👶👵
- **Gender**: The gender of the patient 👩👨
- **HeartRate**: The patient's heart rate (beats per minute) 💓
- **BloodPressure**: The patient's blood pressure (Systolic/Diastolic) 💉
- **RespiratoryRate**: The patient's respiratory rate 🌬️
- **BodyTemperature**: The patient's body temperature (°F) 🌡️
- **ActivityLevel**: The level of physical activity (e.g., resting, walking, running) 🏃‍♂️
- **OxygenSaturation**: The patient's oxygen saturation percentage 💨
- **SleepQuality**: The quality of the patient's sleep (e.g., excellent, good, fair, poor) 🛌
- **StressLevel**: The patient's stress level (e.g., low, moderate, high) 😓
- **Timestamp**: The timestamp of the recorded data ⏰

## Analysis and Visualizations 📊
The notebook includes visualizations and descriptive statistics for the following:

- **Age Distribution**: A count plot displaying the distribution of age categories (Senior, Young, Middle-aged) 👵👶
- **Blood Pressure Distribution**: The distribution of blood pressure categories such as Normal, Elevated, and Hypertension stages 💉
- **Heart Rate Distribution**: A count plot showing the distribution of heart rate categories (Low, Normal, High) ❤️
- **Oxygen Saturation Levels**: A visualization of normal and low oxygen saturation categories 💨

We also explore the relationships between variables using correlation heatmaps. 🔥

## Outliers and Data Cleaning 🧹
The dataset contains missing values, particularly in the **BodyTemperature** and **OxygenSaturation** columns. These values are filled using the **median** to ensure completeness and facilitate further analysis.

## Key Insights 💡
- **Age Distribution**: Seniors form the largest age group 👵
- **Blood Pressure**: Most individuals have normal blood pressure, with fewer cases of hypertension 💉
- **Heart Rate**: A majority of individuals maintain a normal heart rate 💓
- **Oxygen Saturation**: The majority have normal oxygen saturation levels 🌬️

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis 🐍
- **Pandas** for data processing 📦
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization 🎨
