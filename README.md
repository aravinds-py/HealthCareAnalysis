# Health Monitoring and Analysis 🏥📊

Welcome to the **Health Monitoring and Analysis** project! This repository contains a health data analysis focused on various health metrics such as **Heart Rate**, **Blood Pressure**, **Body Temperature**, **Oxygen Saturation**, **Sleep Quality**, and **Stress Level**. The goal is to explore patterns and relationships within the data to gain insights about health metrics across different groups.

## Project Overview 🔍
This analysis uses a health dataset to examine various metrics, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and more. We explore how these metrics vary with factors like age, gender, and activity levels. The data is processed to handle missing values and outliers, followed by visualizations and correlations to draw meaningful conclusions. 📊

## Data Description 📈
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **PatientID**: Unique identifier for each patient 🆔
- **Age**: The age of the patient 👶👵
- **Gender**: The gender of the patient 👩👨
- **HeartRate**: The patient's heart rate (beats per minute) 💓
- **BloodPressure**: The patient's blood pressure (Systolic/Diastolic) 💉
- **RespiratoryRate**: The patient's respiratory rate 🌬️
- **BodyTemperature**: The patient's body temperature (°F) 🌡️
- **ActivityLevel**: The level of physical activity (e.g., resting, walking, running) 🏃‍♂️
- **OxygenSaturation**: The patient's oxygen saturation percentage 💨
- **SleepQuality**: The quality of the patient's sleep (e.g., excellent, good, fair, poor) 🛌
- **StressLevel**: The patient's stress level (e.g., low, moderate, high) 😓
- **Timestamp**: The timestamp of the recorded data ⏰
